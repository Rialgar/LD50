# Delay the Flood

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 50. The theme was "Delay the inevitable".

[![Screenshot of the game. Squares in various shades of green and brown represent terrain in a top-down view. Blue water is coering about half of them. 4 identical gold and yellow "beacons" and one bigger "colony core" are spread on the uncovered land.](./screenshots/main.png)](https://rialgar.github.io/LD50/)

You can not stop the flood, but you can change the terrain to delay it from reaching the colony core until the subspace beacons activate.

Obviously inspired by Creeper World, but instead of an RTS it is an ... action-puzzler, I guess?

Sorry to any colorblind players, I did not manage an alternative color scheme or proper textures :(
